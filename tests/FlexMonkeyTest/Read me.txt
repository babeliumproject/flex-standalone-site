In this directory can be found different files and folders:
-Snapshost directory, monkeyTestProject.xml file and monkeyTestSuites.xml file were created
directly from flexMonkey desktop application. If you want to load the project from flexmonkey
application you must load monkeyTestProject.xml file from app load browser.
-testSuites folder contains flexmonkey´s test in action script 3 code. This folders contains
the files that you must use for automatically testings.


HOW TO CHECK THE TEST:
----------------------
If you want to check the test, you need flexmonkey desktop application. You can download it
from the next web site: http://www.gorillalogic.com/

Once you´ve got flexmonkey app installed on your computer, you will be able to open flexmonkey
test project by clicking in File/Open_project and choosing the root folder (wich name is 'FlexMonkeyTest').

Now, you must init your IDE (eclipse, flash builder...) and add in Compiler/adittional_compiler_arguments
the following lines: 
-include-libraries "../libs/automation_monkey.swc" -include-libraries "${flexlib}/libs/automation.swc" 
-include-libraries "${flexlib}/libs/automation_agent.swc" -include-libraries "${flexlib}/libs/automation_dmv.swc"

A file is necesary in you project/lib folder. The file that you must add can download from gorillalogic/flex monkey/
monkey accesories but you must choose the file that corresponds with you flex sdk version.

When you added the automation file in lib folder, you can launch babelia and run flexmonkey´s test directly from
desktop application.
