AMFPHP configuration notes
==========================

In order for VO objects to work AMFPHP globals.php default configuration must be slightly changed.

$voPath should be changed from services/vo to services/ because we're not using separate folders
for our DAO and VO classes.

Also, all VO classes (both AS3 and PHP) must have it's 

	$_explicitType = "folder.ExampleVO"

and 
	
	[RemoteClass(alias="folder.ExampleVO")]
	
Pointed to the same path.

All of babelia's services are stored under amfphp's /services/babelia folder.

Migrate from AMFPHP to Zend AMF
===============================

Download and unzip Zend Framework to a place of your choice.

I'll explain this with an example path to make things clearer. 

Supose all your Zend Framework files are under C:\AppServ\php5\includes\Zend\

On that place we can see Acl.php, Application.php, Auth.php, and so on.

Now, first we add C:\AppServ\php5\includes to our php.ini's include_path.

Second we export server.php file (our services gateway) to the root of our web server.
For example,

	C:\AppServ\www\server.php

Last but not least, remember to export all the services and their VOs to the usual place.

	C:\AppServ\www\amfphp\services\babelia
	
(In the future this folder might change to C:\AppServ\www\services since 
 we no longer need amfphp's classes on our webserver).

REMEMBER: You must import your new DAOs on the server.php as well as the VOs.




Youtube ZEND GDATA PHP API notes
================================

For guidance on how to install Zend's Youtube Data API follow this guide:

	http://code.google.com/intl/en/apis/gdata/articles/php_client_lib.html#gdata-installation
	
In short, you need to add one path to your php.ini file's "include_path". This path would point to
Zend's GData Library. After that, you need to enable php's extensions and load open_ssl for php.

Youtube Video Upload notes
==========================

Depending on the bandwidth of your server/hosting service and the video file sizes you're allowing your users
to upload php scripts may take a lot of time to finish so you must vary the maximum time a script can be
running on php. Elseways, you'll get a nice and non-understandable error thrown from your amfphp parser.

To change the amount of seconds one script can last, open your php.ini file and find the "max_execution_time"
entry. We suggest you put something between 120 seconds and 600 seconds to have things go smoothly.

Youtube and Google accounts combining and getting developer keys for API interaction
====================================================================================

You should be aware that in order to use youtube's data API your Youtube and Google account (such as Gmail)
must be combined. If you "google" for it you'll find it's very easy to accomplish so I won't bother explaining
it here.

Next, you should get a developer key to actually interact with the data API. To do this go to the following URL:

	http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/dashboard/
	
and in no time you'll get your developer key which grants you to upload 2000 videos per account.
